    <dir><section>CHOWMEIN</section>Chow mein, in English, means fried noodles, whereas lo mein translates to stirred or tossed noodles. So essentially, it's the way the noodles are prepared that makes them different, as the noodles in both dishes are made from wheat flour and eggs, which is similar to the ingredients of Italian pasta.</dir></div>

    <dir><section>MOMOS</section>Momos are made of a simple flour and water dough. White flour is generally preferred, and sometimes a little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more 'doughy' texture to the finished product.</dir>
